/**
 * Randomized multiplicative spanner calculation by propagating random messages
 * through the graph.
 *
 * M. Elkin und O. Neiman. Efficient Algorithms for Constructing Very Sparse Spanners
 * and Emulators. ACM Trans. Algorithms 15.1 (Nov. 2018). doi: 10.1145/3274651.
 *
 * Conditions for the graph:
 * - undirected
 * - unweighted
 *
 * The stretch \f$s\f$ must satisfy: \f$s\in\{1,3,5,7,\ldots\}\f$.
 *
 * The preconditions can be checked with SpannerElkinNeiman::preconditionsOk.
 *
 * Calculates a \f$(2k-1)\f$-spanner with size \f$\mathcal{O}(n^{1+1/k}/\epsilon)\f$,
 * \f$0<\epsilon<1\f$. The runtime is \f$\mathcal{O}(m)\f$ with a success probability
 * of at least \f$1-\epsilon\f$.
 *
 * Note that in practice, \f$\epsilon\f$ can be larger than 1 which can result in even better
 * results, but has a larger probability of failing. Remember, that the success probability
 * is a lower bound, so larger \f$\epsilon\f$ does not imply that it is impossible to generate
 * a solution.
 *
 * @note
 * Implementation details:
 *
 * Since the paper does not state much detail about the algorithm, some things must be explained
 * here that are not trivial:
 * - "Each vertex x that received a message originated at u, stores [...] a neighbor p_u(x)
 * 	 that lies on a shortest path from x to u": This also includes, that the message must be send
 *   via a shortest path. In the implementation a breadth first search is used since the graph is
 *   unweighted (no need for dijkstra). With marking visited notes it is ensured that when visiting
 *   a node the first time, it *is* a shortest path.
 * - Continuing: "(this neighbor sent x the message from u, breaking ties arbitrarily if there is
 *   more than one)". To not make the code more complicated to search for all shortest paths, saving
 *   them into a list and in a second step choosing one random element from the list, just *the first*
 *   shortest path is taken (see above). It works and the results do not seem to be much worse.
 * - There are two feasibility checks below with the second one modified. See the comment at the very
 *   end of the execute function.
 * - The paper describes the algorithm, that u broadcasts a value to all nodes within distance k. Then,
 *   each receiving node x is handled (e.g. building m(x) and C(x) only with respect to x). If it is
 *   implemented this way, there has to be a n*n matrix for m_u(x) and p_u(x) which is very memory consuming.
 *   Tests with some large instances (n about 40000) resulted in out of memory issues during the
 *   initialization of the arrays.
 *   To lower the memory footprint to just O(n), the logic is switched around: The algorithm always fixes
 *   a receiving node x, which is fine for the later parts. So now all nodes u are searched, that sends
 *   a message to x. This can also be done by the same BFS with little modification. In summary, this allows
 *   for just storing the value and edge for each node, not a matrix of nodes.
