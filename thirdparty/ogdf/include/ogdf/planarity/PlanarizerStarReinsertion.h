//! The star (re-)insertion approach for crossing minimization.
/**
 * @ingroup ga-crossmin
 *
 * This crossing minimization module represents a customizable implementation of
 * the star insertion approach. This approach consists of two phases.
 * In the first phase, a planarization of the graph is computed, i.e. a
 * planarized representation with crossings replaced by dummy nodes of degree 4.
 * In the second phase, a set of original nodes (each with its star insertion
 * paths) is re-inserted with as few crossings as possible, until no improvement
 * is possible anymore (the configuration is "locally optimal" or a maximum
 * number of iterations is reached.
 *
 * The first step, i.e. the computation of the planarization, is implemented via
 * a module option while the maximum number of iterations can be set directly.
 *
 * More details on the star insertion approach can be found in
 *
 * K. Clancy, M. Haythorpe, A. Newcombe:
 * <i>An effective crossing minimisation heuristic based on star insertion</i>.
 * J. Graph Algorithms Appl. 23(2): 135-166 (2019)

 * The various phases of the algorithm can be exchanged by setting
 * module options allowing flexible customization. The algorithm provides
 * the following module options:
 *
 * <table>
 *   <tr>
 *     <th><i>Option</i><th><i>Type</i><th><i>Default</i><th><i>Description</i>
 *   </tr><tr>
 *     <td><i>planarization</i><td>CrossingMinimizationModule
 *     <td>SubgraphPlanarizer using FixedEmbeddingInserter
 *     <td>The module for the computation of the planar subgraph.
 *   </tr>
